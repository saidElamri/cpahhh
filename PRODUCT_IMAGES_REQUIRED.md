## How to Replace Placeholders

1. **Prepare your images:**
   - Optimize for web (compress but maintain quality)
   - Name files descriptively (e.g., `nipple-pasties-hero.jpg`)
   - Ensure proper dimensions

2. **Upload to your server:**
   - Place in `/images/` directory
   - Or use a CDN/image hosting service

3. **Update HTML:**
   - Open `index.html`
   - Find placeholder image URLs
   - Replace with your actual image paths
   - Example: `src="images/nipple-pasties-hero.jpg"`

4. **Update all image references:**
   - Hero image (line ~117)
   - Main product image (line ~159)
   - All thumbnails (lines ~169-191)
   - Open Graph image (line ~22)
   - Twitter Card image (line ~30)
   - Structured data images (lines ~40-42)

## Current Placeholder Locations

All images currently use `via.placeholder.com` with text labels. Search for "REPLACE+WITH+ACTUAL" in `index.html` to find all locations.

## SEO Considerations

When replacing images:
1. **Use descriptive file names:** `luxe-nipple-pasties-hero.jpg` not `img1.jpg`
2. **Add detailed alt text:** Already optimized in HTML
3. **Optimize file sizes:** Fast loading = better SEO
4. **Use proper dimensions:** Avoid stretching/distortion
5. **Include product in image:** Helps with image search SEO

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Placeholders are in place and clearly labeled
2. 📸 Source or create actual product images
3. 🔄 Replace all placeholder URLs
4. ✅ Test all images load correctly
5. ✅ Verify on mobile devices
6. ✅ Check social media previews
